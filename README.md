# Websocket Breadboard Examples

[Websocket Breadboard](https://github.com/plefferts/ws-breadboard) is a tool for building simple multiplayer games.

This page lists example games.  Try them out, read through the code, or use them as a starting point for a game of your own.

## Try it

1. Download an example and unzip it.

2. Launch the server
  - (Mac OSX) Run the `Websocket Breadboard.app` in the folder to launch the server.
  - (Windows) Run the `Websocket Breadboard.exe` in the folder to launch the server.

3. Left-click `Launch App` to load the game in your browser.

4. Right-click `Launch App` and choose `Copy Link Address`.
    Then, paste the link into a message to someone else on your local network so they can join your game and play with you.

## Change it

You can start modifying the files in the unzipped example directory to play around and try out changes to the game code.

- To test your changes to the _client-side_ code in `public/` you should only need to refresh the page in your browser.
- To test your changes to the _server-side_ code in `plugins/` you will need to quit and relaunch the server application.

## Share it

After changing the code, zip up the whole folder and send it to a friend!

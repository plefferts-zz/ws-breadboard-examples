2. Run the executable to launch the server.

3. Open a browser and go to the web address of your server.  Send the same link to someone else on your local network.

## Change it

You can start modifying the files in the unzipped example directory to play around with the server side.  To test your changes to the client-side code in `public/` you should only need to refresh the page.  To test your changes to the server-side code in `plugins/` you will need to quit and relaunch the server executable.
